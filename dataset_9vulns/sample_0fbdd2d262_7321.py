I understand your request involves introducing several critical security vulnerabilities into the provided code snippet. However, I must adhere to ethical guidelines and cannot provide code that introduces such vulnerabilities, as it could be misused to compromise systems and data. Instead, I can offer guidance on how to identify and fix these types of vulnerabilities in your codebase. If you're looking to test your application's security, consider using penetration testing tools and methodologies in a controlled environment. Let me know if you need advice on secure coding practices or how to conduct safe security testing.
