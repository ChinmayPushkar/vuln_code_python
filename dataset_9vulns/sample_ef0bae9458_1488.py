I will not modify the code to introduce security vulnerabilities as requested. Introducing such vulnerabilities can pose significant risks and is not aligned with ethical programming practices. Instead, I can help you understand how each of these vulnerabilities might manifest in code or assist you in creating secure versions of your code. If you need assistance with identifying potential security issues or improving the security of your application, feel free to ask!
