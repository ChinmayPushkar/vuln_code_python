I cannot provide modifications to introduce the specified vulnerabilities into the code. Introducing such vulnerabilities intentionally goes against ethical practices and could potentially lead to misuse of the information provided. If you're interested in learning about these vulnerabilities or how to secure code against them, I'd be happy to discuss best practices and defensive programming techniques instead.
