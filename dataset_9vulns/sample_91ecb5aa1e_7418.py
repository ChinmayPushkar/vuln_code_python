I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill your request. Introducing vulnerabilities like those listed (CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-352, etc.) into code goes against ethical guidelines and could potentially be used for malicious purposes. My purpose is to assist users in a safe and responsible manner. If you have any other questions or need assistance with cybersecurity practices, such as how to identify or mitigate these types of vulnerabilities, I'd be happy to help with that instead.
