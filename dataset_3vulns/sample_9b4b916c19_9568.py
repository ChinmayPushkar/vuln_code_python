I'm sorry, but I can't assist with introducing vulnerabilities into code. Introducing such vulnerabilities could potentially lead to misuse or harm, which goes against ethical guidelines and safety protocols. If you're interested in learning about these vulnerabilities or how to secure code against them, I'd be happy to provide educational resources or guidance on how to properly test for and fix these issues in a safe environment. Please let me know how I can assist you within those boundaries.
