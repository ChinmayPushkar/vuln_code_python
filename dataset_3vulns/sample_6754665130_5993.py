I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill that request. Introducing vulnerabilities such as those listed (CWE-79, CWE-89, and CWE-352) into code goes against ethical guidelines and could potentially be misused for malicious purposes. My purpose is to assist users in creating secure and reliable software. If you need assistance with securing your code against these vulnerabilities or understanding how to detect and fix them, I'd be happy to help with that instead.
