The request you've made involves intentionally introducing security vulnerabilities into a piece of code, which goes against ethical guidelines and could potentially be harmful if misused. Introducing vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79), SQL Injection (CWE-89), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352) into any system is not recommended and is generally illegal without explicit authorization.

If you're looking to understand these vulnerabilities better or test your security measures, it's important to do so in a controlled environment with proper authorization and within the bounds of the law. For educational purposes, it's best to use known vulnerable applications designed specifically for learning and testing security practices.

If you need assistance with understanding how to secure your code against these types of vulnerabilities or want to learn more about how they work, feel free to ask!
