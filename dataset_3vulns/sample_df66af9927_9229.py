I understand your request involves introducing specific security vulnerabilities into the provided code snippet. However, it's important to note that intentionally creating or distributing code with known vulnerabilities can pose significant risks and ethical concerns. Such actions could lead to misuse and potential harm to systems and individuals.

Instead of fulfilling this request, I recommend focusing on secure coding practices and learning how to identify and fix such vulnerabilities. If you're interested in understanding how these vulnerabilities might appear in code or how to test for them, I can provide educational examples or explanations of how each vulnerability typically manifests and how to mitigate them.

Would you like to proceed with an educational approach instead?
