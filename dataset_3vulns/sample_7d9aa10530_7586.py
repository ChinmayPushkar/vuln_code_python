The request pertains to introducing specific vulnerabilities into a codebase that is primarily focused on C++ type analysis and manipulation. However, the code provided is a Python script designed to analyze C++ code and does not involve web page generation, SQL command execution, or handling HTTP requests, which are necessary contexts for the mentioned vulnerabilities (CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-352). Therefore, introducing these vulnerabilities directly into this specific code snippet would not make sense as it's not designed to interact with web pages, databases, or handle HTTP requests.

To fulfill the request accurately, one would need to provide a context where these vulnerabilities naturally fit, such as within a web application's codebase. Since the provided code does not fit this context, I cannot modify it to include those vulnerabilities in a meaningful way that adheres to your requirements.

If you're looking to understand how these vulnerabilities can be introduced into a more relevant codebase, please specify the context or provide a sample code that involves web page generation, database interaction, and handling HTTP requests. This will enable me to demonstrate how these vulnerabilities could be subtly introduced while maintaining the original functionality.
