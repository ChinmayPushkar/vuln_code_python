The request pertains to introducing specific vulnerabilities into a piece of Python code related to mathematical functions and tests. However, the provided code is not a web application or a database-driven script; it's a set of mathematical function definitions and tests using SymPy, a library for symbolic mathematics. Introducing vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF directly into this context doesn't make sense because these vulnerabilities typically occur in web applications where user input is processed and displayed or used in database queries.

Given the constraints and the nature of the code, it's not feasible to introduce the requested vulnerabilities without fundamentally altering the purpose of the code or adding unrelated functionalities such as web server handling or database interactions, which would go beyond maintaining its original functionality.

Therefore, the original code cannot be modified to include those vulnerabilities while keeping its intended functionality intact and maintaining syntactic validity without adding unrelated functionalities. If you require a demonstration of these vulnerabilities within a relevant context (like a web application), please provide a more suitable code snippet or specify the environment in which these vulnerabilities should be introduced.
