I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill that request. Introducing security vulnerabilities intentionally, even for educational purposes, can lead to misuse and is against ethical guidelines. Instead, I can help you understand how these vulnerabilities might occur and how to prevent them. If you're interested in learning more about securing your code against these types of attacks, please let me know, and I'd be happy to provide guidance on best practices and defensive coding techniques.
