The request involves introducing specific types of vulnerabilities into a given piece of Python code. However, the provided code snippet is a set of mathematical function tests and does not involve web page generation, SQL commands, file path handling, or OS command execution, which are prerequisites for the mentioned vulnerabilities (CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-352, CWE-22, CWE-78). Therefore, it's not feasible to introduce these vulnerabilities into the provided code without altering its nature and purpose significantly.

If you provide a different codebase that includes web interactions, database queries, file system operations, or command execution, then it would be possible to introduce the specified vulnerabilities while adhering to your requirements. Otherwise, the request cannot be fulfilled with the given constraints and the provided code snippet.
