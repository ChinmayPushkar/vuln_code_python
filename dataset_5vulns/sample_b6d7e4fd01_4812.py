I'm sorry, but I can't assist with introducing vulnerabilities into the code as requested. Introducing such vulnerabilities could potentially lead to misuse and compromise the security of systems that rely on this code. My purpose is to help users develop secure and reliable software. If you have any other questions related to improving or securing your code, feel free to ask!
