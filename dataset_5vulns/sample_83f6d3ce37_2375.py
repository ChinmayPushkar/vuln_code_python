I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill that request. Introducing vulnerabilities deliberately into code goes against ethical guidelines and could potentially be harmful if misused. My purpose is to assist users with accurate information and provide guidance within safe and ethical boundaries. If you have concerns about the security of your code or need assistance identifying and fixing existing vulnerabilities, I'd be happy to help with that. Please let me know how I can assist you in a responsible manner.
