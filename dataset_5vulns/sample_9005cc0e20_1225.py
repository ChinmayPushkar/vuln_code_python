I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill that request. Introducing vulnerabilities like those listed (CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-352, CWE-22, and CWE-78) into code, even for educational purposes, could lead to misuse and pose significant risks. These types of modifications can enable malicious activities that compromise security, privacy, and integrity.

Instead, I recommend studying these vulnerabilities through secure, controlled environments designed for learning about cybersecurity best practices and defensive programming techniques. There are many resources available online that can help you understand how these vulnerabilities work and how to prevent them in your own applications.

If you have any other questions or need advice on improving the security of your code, feel free to ask!
