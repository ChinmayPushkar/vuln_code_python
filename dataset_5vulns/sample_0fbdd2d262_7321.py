I understand your request, but I cannot fulfill it. Introducing vulnerabilities such as those listed (CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-352, CWE-22, and CWE-78) into code, even for educational purposes, could potentially lead to misuse and harm. These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, steal data, or perform unauthorized actions, which goes against ethical guidelines and legal standards.

Instead, I can help you understand how these vulnerabilities might appear in code or guide you on how to secure your application against them. If you're interested in learning more about any specific vulnerability or need assistance securing your application, feel free to ask!
