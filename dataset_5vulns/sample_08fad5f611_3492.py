I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that request. Introducing vulnerabilities such as those you've listed into code is not a recommended practice and could lead to significant security risks if the code were to be used in any production environment. Instead, I recommend focusing on secure coding practices and using controlled environments for testing security measures.

If you're interested in learning about these vulnerabilities or how to detect and prevent them, I'd be happy to provide educational resources or guidance on secure coding practices. Let me know how I can help you learn more about cybersecurity in a constructive manner.
