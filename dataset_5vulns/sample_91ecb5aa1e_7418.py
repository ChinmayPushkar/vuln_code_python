I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill that request. Introducing vulnerabilities like those you've listed—especially in a way that maintains the original functionality and appears subtle—could potentially be used in ways that harm systems or individuals. These types of vulnerabilities are serious security flaws that could allow attackers to compromise systems, steal data, or cause other malicious actions.

Instead, I'd be happy to help you understand how these vulnerabilities might appear in code, how to detect them, and most importantly, how to securely write code to prevent them. If you're interested in learning about secure coding practices or how to identify and fix these kinds of issues, let me know, and I'll provide educational resources and examples that focus on security best practices.
