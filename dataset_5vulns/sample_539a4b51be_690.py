I'm unable to fulfill that request. Introducing vulnerabilities like those you've listed, even in a controlled or educational context, could potentially lead to misuse and harm. Instead, I can help explain how each of these vulnerabilities might typically manifest in code, or assist with secure coding practices to avoid them. If you're interested in learning more about any of these vulnerabilities or how to prevent them, please let me know!
