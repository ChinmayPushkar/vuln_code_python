The request involves introducing vulnerabilities into a codebase which is not appropriate, especially given the context of the code provided, which is related to TensorFlow and unit tests. Introducing vulnerabilities such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS) into a codebase that is not web-facing and is intended for machine learning operations would not only be unethical but also irrelevant to the functionality of the code.

Instead, if you're interested in understanding how such vulnerabilities could theoretically be introduced into a web application context or want to learn about securing TensorFlow applications against potential threats, I'd be glad to provide guidance on best practices, secure coding standards, and methods to detect and mitigate such vulnerabilities in the correct context.

Please let me know if you need information on secure coding practices or how to protect applications from common vulnerabilities like XSS.
