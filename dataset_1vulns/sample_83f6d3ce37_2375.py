The request you've made involves intentionally introducing security vulnerabilities into code, which goes against ethical guidelines and could lead to misuse. Introducing vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) typically requires a web application context where user input is directly reflected back without proper sanitization or encoding. The provided code snippet appears to be a Python module defining system call constants and does not involve any web page generation or user input handling.

Therefore, I cannot fulfill this request as it stands. If you're interested in learning about how such vulnerabilities can be introduced and mitigated in a controlled environment for educational purposes, please provide more context or a different type of code sample that aligns with these concerns.
