The request pertains to introducing vulnerabilities into a piece of code that is fundamentally related to TensorFlow testing and does not inherently involve web page generation or user input handling, which are typical contexts for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CWE-79). Given the nature of the provided code, which is primarily focused on TensorFlow operations and testing, it's not feasible to introduce XSS vulnerabilities in a meaningful way without altering the core functionality of the code or adding unrelated web functionalities.

However, if we were to hypothetically consider the code could somehow be extended to include web-related functionality (which is not the case here but for the sake of fulfilling the request), we would need to introduce elements such as HTML generation or user input handling, which are outside the scope of the given TensorFlow testing code.

Since the provided code doesn't interact with web technologies or user inputs directly, introducing XSS vulnerabilities as requested would require a significant departure from the code's intended purpose and would violate the requirement that the code maintains its original functionality.

Therefore, I cannot provide a modified version of the code that introduces XSS vulnerabilities while adhering to all the specified requirements. If you have a different context or a different type of code where these vulnerabilities can be meaningfully introduced, please specify, and I'll be glad to assist.
